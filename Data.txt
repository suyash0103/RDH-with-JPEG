Reversible data hiding (RDH) is a special type of information hiding. With RDH, besides the embedded secret data, the cover medium can be recovered from the marked data as well. So far, there is a rapid increase of applications utilizing RDH, and several examples have been reported in the literature including image authentication, medical image processing, video error-concealment coding, stereo image coding, and data coloring in the cloud [1]. Many effective RDH methods have been proposed nowadays. However, most of them are developed for uncompressed images in BMP format, only a few works are devoted to JPEG image RDH. As known, JPEG is the most popular image format and JPEG images are widely used in the reality. In this light, JPEG images are ideal covers for RDH, and the JPEG image RDH is highly desired. In this work, we consider JPEG images as covers and propose an efficient JPEG image RDH scheme.
